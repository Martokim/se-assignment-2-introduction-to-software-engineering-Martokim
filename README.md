Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:Software engineering is all about using a methodical and organized approach to create, manage, and maintain software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
 software engineering is a comprehensice approach for creating , planning managing and maintaining software while traditional programming involves writing code to create software. It primarily focuses on the act of coding and immediate problem-solving without a structured methodology.
Refferences:Schwalbe, K. (2015). Information Technology Project Management (8th Edition). Cengage Learning.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
1.Planning phase :-first step where you decide what you want the software to achieve and whether its possible to crate it within the timeframe and budget.
2.Requirements Analysis phase:- here, you gather detailed information about what the software needs to do from the people who will use it .
3.Design phase:- plan out how each part of the software will work and how they will all fit together .
4.coding :- involves writing the actual code of your software
5.Testing :- after the software is built, one needs to test it to make sure it works correctly and doesn't have bugs
6.Deployment :- once the software passes all the tests , it is ready to be released to the users . 
7.Maintanance :- After the software is released, it will require regular updates and fixes to keep it running smoothly.

Agile vs Waterfall models
Waterfall Model
 -sequential approach; where you complete one phase entirely before moving on to the next.
 -Predicable ; its very structured and you can predict the timeline and costs more easily because you have a clear   plan from the beginning .
 -Rigid ; Once a phase is completed , it's hard to go back and make changes .
Agile model
 -iIterative approach; you work in small manageable pieces called iterations on sprints.
 -Flexible; it allwos for changes and improvements at any stage.
 -Collaborative; Agile involves regular feedback from users and stakeholders throughout the development process
 Reference:Reference: Beck, K. et al. (2001). Manifesto for Agile Software Development.



Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Key differences betweeen agile and waterfall models include :-
1.process flow: waterfall model uses linear/sequatiol while Agile uses iterative and incremental process flow.
2.Flexibility:Waterfall model is rigid and less adaptable to changes while Agile is highly adaptable with frequent reassesments and adjustments.
3.User involvement: Waterfall has limited user involvement after requirements are gathered while Agile has continous user involvement and feedback.
4.Documentation : waterfall has heavy documentation upront while agile has light documentation with focus on working software 
5.Delivery : waterfall is delivered at the end of the project while Agile is delivered in small , functional pieces throughout the project.
The following are scenarios that Agilee model may be used
-Dynamic projects: convenient where project requirements are expected to change .
 -Customer-centric projects: suitable when contionous user feedback and involvement are critical.
 -Time-sensitive projects: Agile is suitable when project timelines are tight and there is a need to deliver.
 The following are scenarios that Waterfall model may be used:-
  -Well defined projects: projects with clear and unchanging requirements.
  -Predictable Environments:Suitable when the scope is fixed, and the project is unlikely to enconter significant changes.
  -Regulated Industries:Waterfall model is suitable in industries where strict compliance with regulations is required
  Reference: Beck, K. et al. (2001). Manifesto for Agile Software Development.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
 Requirements engineering is the process of documenting , defining and managing the requirements of a software system.
 The process involves:-
 1.Elicitation : involves getting information from varous souces e.g users , customers , stakeholders and system administrators.
 2.Analysis:The gathered requirements are analyzed for completeness , consistency and prioritization.
 3.Specification: Documented requirements are created using clear and concise language.
 4.Validation: the document requirements are validated with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs.
 5.Management:requirements are managed and tracked for changes and updates.
 The following are the importances of requirements engineering.
  1.Quality assuarance : Ensures the final product meets user needs and expectations, leading to higher user satisfaction and fewer post-deployment issues.
  2.Reduced maintanance costs: Identifying and addressing requirements early on can reduce the likelihood of costly.
  3.Increased user satisfaction :By building software based on documented needs, requerement engineering increases the chances of delivering a product that meets user expectations.
  4.Foundation for Design and Development:Provides a solid basis for  designing and development phases reducing misunderstandings and errors.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
 Modularity is the practice of sub-dividing a software system into smaller units or modules each performing a specific task.
 It improves maintainability by breaking down a complex system into manageable parts, it becomes easier to understand and maintain.
 It also improves scalability in that modules can be scaled independently based on their performance needs.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
 Testing is a critical part of the software development lifecycle that helps ensure the delivery of high-quality, reliable, and user-friendly software.
 The different levels of software testing are:-
 1.Unit testing: Testing individual units of code to ensure they function as expected.
 2.Intergration Testing:Tests the interaction between intergrated units or components.
 3.System Testing: tests the complete and fully intergrated software system.
 4.Acceptance Testing: tests the software form the user's perspective to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
version control systems are tools that help manage changes to source code over time by keeping track of every modification made to the codebase.
They are important in software development because they allow multiple developers to collaborate on a project, track changes.
Examples of popular version control systems include ,git,subversion and mecurial.
